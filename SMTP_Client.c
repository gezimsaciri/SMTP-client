    PUT QUESTIONS HERE:
*   Do we need a UI for this? can we somehow use tkinter or are we stuck width
    a command line interface
*   Let's brainstorm classes (structs) that we'll need so we have some sense of
    where to head
*   Is there a sockets interface we are allowed to use? or are we writing that
    too... basically is there anything we don't have to write
*   should we make a makefile to make compilation slightly easier

// ON WINDOWS:
// To compile, do: gcc SMTP_Client.c --> this will create an executable 'a.exe' by default
// do ./a.exe to execute it

// REMEMBER you gotta write the .h on all these
#include <stdio.h>
